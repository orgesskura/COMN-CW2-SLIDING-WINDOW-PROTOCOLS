# COMN-CW2-SLIDING-WINDOW-PROTOCOLS
The overall goal of this assignment is to implement and evaluate different protocols for
achieving end-​to-​end reliable data transfer at the application layer over the unreliable
datagram protocol (UDP) transport protocol. In particular, we were asked to implement
in Python three different communication protocols – ​ Stop​-and-​Wait, Go Back N and
Selective Repeat – at the application layer using UDP sockets. For each of the protocols, I implemented the two protocol endpoints referred henceforth
as ​ sender and ​ receiver respectively. The results of my implementations are on the Result.pdf.

Sender1 and Receiver use UDP for communication. Sender2 and Receiver2 use Stop and Wait. Sender3 and Receiver3 use Go Back N. Sender4 and Receiver4 use Selective Repeat.

Received a mark of 90/100.
